Final Workshop ansible-Limor
1.ansible as a tool as great advantages by itself, the biggest one of them is that ansible is designed for multi-tier deployments since starting, AMI might be faster and easier to manage but thatâ€™s only the case when were regarding a small scale.
Another advantage of ansible is that it is in fact simple and easy to learn due to his extensive usage in a simple YAML-based syntax that is easy to understand, read and write it, unlike ami that you have to write everything in laC and maintain them in version control
Due to fact that ansible does not require agents to be installed on everything it manages, it makes it very lightweight and easy to use
It can also easily integrate with many popular tools without any interruption such as Jenkins, Docker, kubernetes etc.
Making it easy to incorporate into existing workflows 
 And of course by ansible being an open-source is another major advantage, it ensures you have a large active community that provides support and resources for user and ansible is also free unlike ami


2.few of the disadvantages of ansible is that it offers limited support for windows 
Also there may be a few features or functionality that is not yet available due to ansible being a rather new tool 
Ansible can be slow when managing large numbers of nodes, this is because Ansible uses SSH to connect to each node and execute tasks.
